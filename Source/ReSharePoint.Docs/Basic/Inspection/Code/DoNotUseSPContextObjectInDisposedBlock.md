###Description
SPContext objects are managed by the SharePoint framework and should not be explicitly disposed in your code.

Inappropriate usage:
[TEST.InapropriateSPContextUsage]

###Resolution
You need to ensure that you only dispose SPSite and SPWeb objects that your code owns.
[TEST.CorrectSPContextUsage]
This method will ensure that a new independent SPSite object is created which you then can dispose without side effects on other code using the SPSite object bound to the current SPContext object.
