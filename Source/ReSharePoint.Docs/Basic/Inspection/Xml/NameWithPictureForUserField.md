###Description
In SharePoint 2013, if schema.xml contains user field with an attribute **ShowField="NameWithPicture"** it is recommended to replace it with **ShowField="NameWithPictureAndDetails"** attribute.

In SP2013 ShowField=”NameWithPicture” can still be used. But in this case, user field will render correctly only if **<JSLink>clienttemplates.js</JSLink>** node is included in all Views. 

Looks like NameWithPicture value is no longer available via sharePoint GUI. It might mean that this value is depricated.

###Resolution
Either **<JSLink>clienttemplates.js</JSLink>** has to be present in all views or **ShowField="NameWithPictureAndDetails"** has to be used instead of ShowField=”NameWithPicture”.
