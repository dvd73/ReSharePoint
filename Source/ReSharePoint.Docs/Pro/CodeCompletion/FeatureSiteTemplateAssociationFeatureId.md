###Note
Feature stapling concept itself is fairly easy to use, but an important aspect in feature stapling is [the order](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mcsnoiwb/archive/2008/05/28/site-provisioning-order.aspx) in which a site is provisioned:

1. global onet.xml
2. Site-scoped features defined in onet.xml, in the order they are defined in the file.
3. Site-scoped stapled features, activated asynchronously, on multiple threads
4. Web-scoped features defined in onet.xml, in the order they are defined in the file.
5. Web-scoped stapled features, activated asynchronously, on multiple threads
6. List instances defined in onet.xml
7. Modules defined in onet.xml
