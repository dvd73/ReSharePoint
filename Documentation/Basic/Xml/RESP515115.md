## RESP515115. Avoid mixed 'ID' and 'Id' names. 

### Description
It might be suggested to avoid mixing up "ID" and "Id" while crafting field:

Here is a potentally confusing usage of upper-case and lower-case "ID" token:

customerID
clientId
documentID
It could be confusing for other people while working with read-write operation on fields, content types and list items.
Besides, it might lead to unplesant typo issues.

### Resolution
Tend to use either "ID" or "Id" token for all cases.
