## RESP515405. Wrong FeatureId for list instance. 

### Description
When creating a list instance manually in a SharePont, it is important to remember to add the right FeatureId attribute to the ListInstance element, if the TemplateType attribute points to a list template which is not in the same feature as the one you are creating the list instance in. If you forget, you will get some very vague error messages.

_Error occurred in deployment step 'Activate Features': Invalid file name._

If left out, SharePoint assumes that the list template exists in the same feature as the list instance.

### Resolution
Check FeatureId attribute value that it should point to the valid feature.
