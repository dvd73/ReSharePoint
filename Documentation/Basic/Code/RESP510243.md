## RESP510243. SPPersistedObject is updated.

### Description
SharePoint 2010+ has security feature to all objects inheriting from SPPersistedObject. This feature explicitly disallows modification of SPPersistedObject objects from content web applications (not CA).

### Resolution
*   Rescope your features so that web application related activity are performed by a web application scoped feature. Notice that you cannot use a site scoped feature – this would just throw another Access Denied error.
*   Disable the security setting (we won’t suggest this, the security setting was created with a purpose in mind), either via power shell or a console app. target property is "**Microsoft.SharePoint.Administration.SPWebService.ContentService.RemoteAdministratorAccessDenied**"
