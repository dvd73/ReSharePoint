## RESP510236. General exception is suppressed.

### Description
The exception itself should not be ignored because it can be affected to regular program flow. There are three exception types (logical groups):
*   **Usage exceptions**. Means you try to use method with wrong parameters. Validate method parameter at first and throw such exception BEFORE main code. Never catch or handle it.
*   **System exceptions**. Raised when something abnormal happened inside the method main code and not related from caller. Generally it is required to re-throw exception up. Catch it only:  
    it is possible to compensate results, make a workaround actions;  
    on the application top level to avoid user from stress from exception technical detals;  
    to wrap original exception into custom exception type.
*   **Application exceptions** like NullReferenceException, InvalidOperation etc. These are about logic problem in code. You can handle its with the same reasons as for system exceptions.
```cs
public void CallerMethod(ControlCollection controlCollection)
{
    try
    {
        CalledMethod("Test");
    }
    // DO NOT CATCH USAGE EXCEPTION
    catch (ArgumentNotSpecifiedException ex)
    {
        // special handling for ArgumentNotSpecifiedException
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        // log it
        throw new WrappedException("Method XXX call  error occurred", e); // wrapped & chained exceptions.
    }
    finally
    {
        // normal clean goes here (like closing open files).
    }
}
 
public void CalledMethod(string p1)
{
    // Validate parameter and throw "usage exception"
    if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(p1))
        throw new ArgumentNotSpecifiedException("Parameter p1 must be specified");
 
    // Here we save data to the storage and the "system exception" could be raised
    try
    {
        DAL.Save(p1);
    }
    catch (SqlException e)
    {
        if (e.ErrorCode != NO_ROW_ERROR)
        {
            // filter out NoDataFound.
            // do special cleanup, like may be closing the "dirty" database connection.
            // throw e; <- DO NOT DO IT. This destroys the strack trace information!
            throw; // this preserves the stack trace
        }
    }
}
```
In case of logging handle exception with re-throw. It will allow to take a decision on the upper level.

### Resolution
*   If method has a [side-effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29) it is strongly recommended to avoid ANY exception suppressions, not only specific type.
*   Specify exception type in the catch clause. Mostly it could be SPException.
*   Rethrow exception in catch(Exception) block using throw or catch specific exception.
