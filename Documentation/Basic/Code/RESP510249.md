## RESP510249. SPWebPartManager is used while HTTPContext is null.

### Description
SharePoint supports a custom implementation of WebPartManager named SPWebPartManager. In addition, there is an SPLimitedWebPartManager class that supports environments that have no HttpContext or Page available.

### Resolution
If you have HttpContext then use SPWebPartManager. When no HttpContext (in event receivers for example) is available you should use SPLimitedWebPartManager. It only supports a subset of features available in SPWebPartManager.
