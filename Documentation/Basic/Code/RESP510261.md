## RESP510261. SPContext objects are disposed.

### Description
SPContext objects are managed by the SharePoint framework and should not be explicitly disposed in your code.

Inappropriate usage:
```cs
public void InapropriateSPContextUsage()
{
    using (var site = SPContext.Current.Site)
    {
    }
}
```

### Resolution
You need to ensure that you only dispose SPSite and SPWeb objects that your code owns.
```cs
public void CorrectSPContextUsage()
{
    using (var site = new SPSite(SPContext.Current.Site.ID))
    {
    }
}
```
This method will ensure that a new independent SPSite object is created which you then can dispose without side effects on other code using the SPSite object bound to the current SPContext object.
